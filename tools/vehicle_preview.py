"""Preview how a .fseq light show will actually behave on each Tesla vehicle.

The xLights project ships a single Model S / Cybertruck superset model, so the
sequencer preview always shows the Model S wiring: every channel is its own
light, and every light switches instantly.  Real vehicles differ.  On Model 3/Y
several xLights channels are OR'd onto one physical output, and several lights
that are boolean on Model S ramp instead.  A show that looks correct in the
preview can therefore look wrong on the car, which is what
https://github.com/teslamotors/light-show/issues/42 reports.

This tool reads a .fseq and reports the places where a given vehicle will not
reproduce what the preview showed, without needing the vehicle.

Usage:
    python3 tools/vehicle_preview.py lightshow.fseq
    python3 tools/vehicle_preview.py lightshow.fseq --vehicle model3
    python3 tools/vehicle_preview.py lightshow.fseq --json
    python3 tools/vehicle_preview.py lightshow.fseq --strict   # non-zero exit

Every behaviour encoded here is sourced from README.md; the section that backs
each rule is named in a `readme` note so the two stay reviewable side by side.

Requires Python 3.7+ and only the standard library, matching validator.py.
